        <h2>Prep Your Carne</h2>
        <p>The first step to creating this master piece is to get your steak ready to cook!Usualy the steak comes prep-packaged and ground up for you, so all you have to do is add the steak to a skillet and start cooking! Beef makes its own oil so we just need seasoning. I use my favorite "O Del Paso" tacoe seasoning as well as a little garlic, and ground black pepper. The key here is to pay attention to the steak, you dont want it to over-cook or under-cook some pieces. Cookins the steak usually takes around 10-20 Miutes, no more than 25 though.</p>

        <h2>Corn Or Flour?</h2>
        <p>Here is where you get your tortillas ready! I use corn, all you have to do is add a little oil to your skillet, and let the tortillas cook for about 3-5 Minutes. They're ready to add Carne!</p>

        <h2>Toppings?</h2>
        <p>Mmmmm, The topppings! The best Ones I add are onions and cilantro, I also add salsa verde. Once you add everything that you wanted, You're finished! Enjoy your creation!</p>
