        <p>Honey walnut shrimp is one of my favorite oriental foods! There are plenty of ways to make it, im going to share my way with you guys today! Let's start with the easy part, the walnuts.</p>

        <h2>Candied Walnut Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here's What You'll Need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Whole Walnuts</li>
            <li>1/3 Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Water</li>
        </ul>
       <h3>Walnut Prep:</h3>
       <p>To make the candied walnuts, melt butter over medium heat then add brown sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add water and bring the mixture to a simmer, then stir in your raw walnuts and cook for 5-6 minutes until the mixture has thickened. Immediately transfer the walnuts on a plate to cool.</p>

     <h3>Shrimp Time!</h3>
     <p>In a large pan or wok, heat neutral oil to 325F and fry your shrimp for 2-3 minutes or until bright red and cooked through. Immediately remove and place on a wire rack to drain.
        The key tip here is to fry your shrimp in batches so the oil does not drop too drastically in temperature. Use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the oil to ensure it does not drop below 300F.</p>

     <h4>Sauce 'N' Toss!</h4>
     <p>Once the shrimp and walnuts are done, itâ€™s time to make the sauce! In a bowl large enough to hold the shrimp and walnuts, mix together Kewpie mayo, honey, condensed milk, lemon juice and salt to taste. Once combined, fold in your shrimp and candied walnuts and your Honey Walnut Shrimp is done!</p>
