    <p>Dont worry if it doesnt look as good, we all have our own touch! :)</p>

    <h2>Wing Prep</h2>
    <p>First Phase, All you have to do (depending on the particular wings you bought) you may have to cut the wings into their smaller parts, the Wingets. For this you want the grab the wing on both sides and cut through the middle. Most people will say "Don't do this step" but trust me its worth it especially nowadays. Wash your wings off and check them to pluck off missed hairs. This is where you grab a big bowl or strainer to put them in, it'll also help with washing them. From here you just season the wings. I personally use garlic powder, seasoned salt, and ground black pepper.</p>

    <h2>Batter/Ready to Fry</h2>
    <p>This next step is just a personal favortie of mine! I add flour to the wings before I drop them in the deep fryer. If that's ot your cup of tea then skip that step and toss them in the fryer, or in your grease, however you prepared it. Let them fry to your liking, i usually le them fry for about 25-30 minutes, no more than 40 minutes. </p>

    <h3>Sauce 'N' Toss!</h3>
    <p>Now it's time to sauce your wings! You can use whatever type of buffalo sauce you prefer. For this i'm usin Frank's Red Hot, my #1. Grab a bowl or pot that's non-stick. Add butter, and heat it up however you prefer, until the butter is melted.Once its fully melted add some garlic powder (you can also add black pepper if you would like, i also add red pepper!) Now add the buffalo sauce and stir until it's all evenly mixed. Last step! Dump the wings and the sauce into a bowl and toss them around until they're saucy enough for you, Now they're ready to serve!</p>
